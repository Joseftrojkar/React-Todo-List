# Project Documentation

## What does the project documentation contain?

This project documentation contains information on a Todo app built using React. It describes what the app does, the technologies used, how it works internally, instructions on how to use the project, and possible future development.

## What the app/game/bot does

The Todo app is a web-based application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The app enables users to add a new task to a list of existing tasks, toggle the completion status of a task, edit the task, and delete a task.

## Description of the technologies used

This project was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The app uses React Hooks, which are a set of functions that allow developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. The app also uses the uuidv4 library to generate unique IDs for the tasks.

## A brief description of how it works internally

The Todo app is built using React, which allows developers to create reusable components. The app is divided into several components, including TodoWrapper, Todo, TodoForm, and EditTodoForm. The TodoWrapper component is the main component that contains the state and logic of the app. The component renders the TodoForm component for adding new tasks and maps over the existing tasks to render the Todo component for each task. The Todo component renders the task, and the EditTodoForm component allows users to edit a task.

The app uses React Hooks to manage state and the useState hook to update state. When a user adds a new task, the app generates a unique ID using the uuidv4 library and adds the task to the list of existing tasks. When a user toggles the completion status of a task, the app updates the task's completed property. When a user edits a task, the app toggles the isEditing property of the task and displays the EditTodoForm component. Finally, when a user deletes a task, the app removes the task from the list of existing tasks.

## Instructions on how to use the project

To use the Todo app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the app.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
6. Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add a new task.
7. Click the task to toggle its completion status.
8. Click the pencil icon to edit a task. Edit the task and click the "Add Task" button to update the task.
9. Click the trash icon to delete a task.

## Possible future development/description of the actual use of the project

Possible future development of the Todo app includes adding features such as authentication, task prioritization, due dates, and reminders. The app can also be extended to allow users to share tasks with others and collaborate on tasks. Additionally, the app can be optimized to improve performance and user experience. The app can also be deployed to a cloud service provider to make it accessible to a wider audience. The actual use of the project can vary, depending on the user's needs. For example, the app can be used for personal task management or for team task management in a work setting.
